# Sentiment-BERT-


Sentiment analysis using BERT involves leveraging the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers model, which excels in understanding context in natural language. By fine-tuning BERT's pre-trained language representations on sentiment-related tasks, it enables accurate classification of text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. This approach harnesses the power of deep learning to capture nuanced emotions and sentiments expressed in text data, facilitating applications in customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and opinion mining.
